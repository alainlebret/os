/**
 * @file thread_with_conditions.c
 *
 * Example using pthreads and conditions.
 * The program creates NUM_THREADS threads. (NUM_THREADS-1) of those threads
 * increment a "count" variable, while the last one reads the value of "count".
 * When "count" reaches a limit (COUNT_LIMIT), the waiting thread is signaled by
 * one of the incrementing threads. The waiting thread "awakens" and then
 * modifies count. The program continues until the incrementing threads reach
 * TOTAL_COUNT. The main program prints the final value of count.
 * This example is adapted from the code at:
 * https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/pthreads/
