/**
 * @file lock_file.c
 *
 * This program demonstrates file locking by attempting to lock a file named 
 * test_lock. If the file is already locked by another process, it waits and
 * retries until it can acquire the lock. Once locked, it holds the lock for
 * 10 seconds before unlocking and exiting.
 *
 * Example using file locking.
 * \code{.bash}
 *   $ touch test_lock
 *   $ lock_file & lock_file
 *   19357 has locked the file
 *   19358 found the file already locked, try again...
 *   19358 found the file already locked, try again...
 *   19358 found the file already locked, try again...
 *   19357 has unlocked the file
 *   19358 has locked the file
 *   19358 has unlocked the file
 * \endcode
