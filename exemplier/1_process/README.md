# Process Examples

This section contains examples related to process management in C. These examples demonstrate various aspects of process creation, management, and communication in Unix-like systems. Below is a list of the source files with descriptions and links to their content.

| File Name        | Description                                                               | Link |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|
| `process_01.c`     | Demonstrates the use of the `fork()` system call to create a child process                             | [process_01.c](https://github.com/alainlebret/os/blob/master/exemplier/1_process/src/process_01.c) |
| `process_02.c`     | Illustrates how a variable's value changes independently in the parent and child processes | [process_02.c](https://github.com/alainlebret/os/blob/master/exemplier/1_process/src/process_02.c) |
| `process_03.c`     | Demonstrates the use of `fork()` to create a child process and uses `sleep()` to block both parent and child processes for a specified duration            | [process_03.c](https://github.com/alainlebret/os/blob/master/exemplier/1_process/src/process_03.c) |
| `process_04a.c`    | Clones a process using `fork()` and gets a zombie                           | [process_04a.c](https://github.com/alainlebret/os/blob/master/exemplier/1_process/src/process_04a.c) |
| `process_04b.c`    | Demonstrates the creation of an orphan process by cloning a process using `fork()` and having the parent process terminate before the child process.              | [process_04b.c](https://github.com/alainlebret/os/blob/master/exemplier/1_process/src/process_04b.c) |
| `process_05.c`     | Demonstrates the use of `fork()` to create a child process, with the parent process waiting for the child process to finish and then checking its exit status      | [process_05.c](https://github.com/alainlebret/os/blob/master/exemplier/1_process/src/process_05.c) |
| `process_06a.c`    | Shows the use of `fork()` to create a child process, which then executes a new program (`ls` command) using `execl()`, while the parent process waits for the child to finish                  | [process_06a.c](https://github.com/alainlebret/os/blob/master/exemplier/1_process/src/process_06a.c) |
| `process_06b.c`    | Shows the use of `fork()` to create a child process, which then executes a new program (`gnuplot`) using `execlp()`, while the parent process waits for the child to finish.      | [process_06b.c](https://github.com/alainlebret/os/blob/master/exemplier/1_process/src/process_06b.c) |
| `process_07.c`     | Shows details about the PID and the group of a process                    | [process_07.c](https://github.com/alainlebret/os/blob/master/exemplier/1_process/src/process_07.c) |
| `process_08.c`     | Creates two child processes using `fork()`. Each child process executes a GTK application (`moving_window`) with different parameters using `execvp()`, while the parent process waits for both to finish.                  | [process_08.c](https://github.com/alainlebret/os/blob/master/exemplier/1_process/src/process_08.c) |
| `process_09.c`     | Creates four child processes using `fork()`. Each child process executes a different application (Firefox, Gedit, VLC) with specific arguments using `execvp()`, while the parent process waits for all to finish    | [process_09.c](https://github.com/alainlebret/os/blob/master/exemplier/1_process/src/process_09.c) |
| `test_thread.c`    | This program prints the process ID and the main thread ID of the executing program                  | [test_thread.c](https://github.com/alainlebret/os/blob/master/exemplier/1_process/src/test_thread.c) |
| `update_w1.sh`     | Bash script to send `SIGUSR1`/ `SIGUSR2` signals to a process                  | [update_w1.sh](https://github.com/alainlebret/os/blob/master/exemplier/1_process/src/update_w1.sh) |
| `moving_window.c`  | GTK window that changes its background color in response to `SIGUSR1` and `SIGUSR2` signals (used by `process_08.c` and `update_w1.sh`)                  | [moving_window.c](https://github.com/alainlebret/os/blob/master/exemplier/1_process/src/moving_window.c) |
